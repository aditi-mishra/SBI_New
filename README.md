# SBI_New
This was an SBI app when i participated in the Bank Hackathon.
It Connects to the Bank Api and gets the data of the customer back when the Account Number is Entered.
Unfortunately, the API's were valid up until the hackathon only so, there might not be any incoming data now.
Apache Libraray is used to connect to the API and make post request to get the data.
